## Simulation Model on Chaotic Asynchronous Transmitter and Receiver 

My undergraduate project on implementing chaotic carrier waveform into information transmissions. This project was funded by the 2015 University of New Haven Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship and the paper was admitted and presented at the 2016 MIT IEEE Undergraduate Research Technology Conference. 

Credits for Dr. Andrew Fish, who took me on this project and greatly broadened my horizon.
